## An Invitation to R for Data Science

These workshops aim to introduce participants to the foundations of data science using R programming Language. As most of you are post-graduate students in geography, adding data science to your bag of skills will important going forward;it will help you in your own research and improving your advantage in labour market.

In this course, we will be using R for programming and data analysis. R, along with other languages such as Python and Julia, is flexible when working with data, especially large data. Majority of academics, researchers, and students who analyse quantitative data use programs such as SPSS, STATA and Excel, and I have also used them before. I discourage the use of these tools for following reasons. Firstly, they are expensive! Universities spend large sums of money to purchase these licences, which disadvantages students and academics in the developing world. On the other hand, R, Python and Julia are free and come with with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY** ðŸ˜Ž . Secondly, programming tools such as R, Python and Julia allow for [*Reproducible Science*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021). Recently, there has been a call among global scientists to make their analyses and results as open as possible. This means sharing the code and all the outputs so that other researchers can examine your work.

I choose to work with R, simply because it is an awesome tool and I f\*\*\*n love it! While I also use Python, however, as a social science student, who did not have a computer science and programming background, R was easier for me to learn.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand R and its functions

-   Conduct basic programming using R

-   Learn to wrangle, clean and transform categorical data

-   Learn to wrangle, clean and transform numerical data

-   Learn the basics of data visualisation using ggplot2

-   Learn how to conduct exploratory data analysis

-   Learn to conduct basic statistical analysis (descriptive and inferential)

-   Learn to communicate and tell stories using data

## Materials

There are tons of materials available online; below I share compulsory and recommended materials we will beusing. There will be additional materials and slides for each section:
