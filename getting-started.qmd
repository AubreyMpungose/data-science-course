In RStudio, you have 4 panes, the script, where you can write lines of code and save the script for future purposes. On the top-right you have the _Environment_ pane, where we can view the list of _objects_ we have created in R; objects can include tables, datasets, models, plots, etc. On bottom-right, we have a console, it is the typical console we found R. Lastly, the last pane have different components/tabs: files tzb, where we can view the list of files we are connected to or are using; for example, where you stored you dataset. It also has a _plot_ tab, used for viewing plots/graphs.
