## Learning objectives

- To understand data types: vectors, dataframe, lists, matrices

- To do basic analysis


## Vectors

Remember objects we created in the [previous section](_site/weeks/week-1.html)? That were all vectors. A vector is the basic data structure used to hold values of the same type. Similar to the previous section, a vector can be:

- numeric

- character

- logical
