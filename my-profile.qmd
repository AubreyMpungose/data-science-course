I am a geographer by training, currently completing my PhD, focusing on the geographies of youth. I work as a lecturer in the School of Education, University of KwaZulu Natal, Pietermaritzburg Campus. My research interests include urban and political geography, political economy, computational social science and quantitative social science. I use data science tools,  computational methods and statistical modelling in my research. I enjoy analysing data in R and Python.
