I completed my MSc in Geography in 2017 and currently completing my PhD, focusing on geographies of youth in Durban. I work as a lecturer in the School of Education, University of KwaZulu Natal, Pietermaritzburg Campus. My research interests include urban and political geography, political economy and computational science. I use data science tools and computational methods in my research and enjoy analysing data.
