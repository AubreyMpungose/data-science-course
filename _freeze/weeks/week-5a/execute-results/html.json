It is an integrated ecosystem, where you can integrate your code, reports, figures, references, tables etc. in one environment. With Quarto you can write:\n\n-   Books (examples include: [R for Data Science, Second dition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/); [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) [Hands-On Programming with R](https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/))\n\n-   Reproducible journal papers: (some examples: [Elsevier Template](https://quarto-journals.github.io/elsevier/), )\n\n-   Website: This website is written with Quarto, hosted in GitHub all for free\n\n-   Presentations: (examples: [This presentation](https://apreshill.github.io/palmerpenguins-useR-2022/))\n\n-   Dynamic reports\n\n-   Blogs: personal, work etc. (examples: )\n\nAnd more! See examples on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/)\n\nQuarto can render documents in multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, word formats, etc.\n\n## 5.2 How does Quarto Work?\n\nFor all my writing, I have shifted from what Kieran Healy calls the \"Office Model\" to an \"Engineering Model\":\n\n> Office solutions tend towards a cluster of tools where something like Microsoft Word is at the center of your work. A Word file or set of files is the most \"real\" thing in your project. Changes to your work are tracked inside that file or files. Citation and reference managers plug into those files. The outputs of data analyses---tables, figures---get cut and pasted in as well, or are kept alongside them. The master document may be passed around from person to person to be edited and updated.4 The final output is exported from it, perhaps to PDF or to HTML, but maybe most often the final output just is the .docx file, cleaned up and with the track changes feature turned off.\n\n> In the Engineering model, meanwhile, plain text files are at the center of your work. The most \"real\" thing in your project will either be those files or, more likely, the version control repository that stores the project. Changes are tracked outside of files, again using a version control system. Data analysis is managed in code that produces outputs in (ideally) a known and reproducible manner. Citation and reference management will likely also be done in plain text, as with a BibTeX .bib file. Final outputs are assembled from the plain text and turned to .tex, .html, or .pdf using some kind of typesetting or conversion tool. Very often, because of some unavoidable facts about the world, the final output of this kind of solution is also a .docx file.\n\nQuarto then is the part of the \"engineering model\". It mainly uses Markdown format for writing. \"Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents\".\n\n## 5.3 Let's Practice\n\nYou will need the following:\n\n-   R and RStudio (or any IDE such as VSCode etc)\n\n-   Quarto: If you are using RStudio, Quarto is already installed. If you using other IDEs such as VSCode, download and install Quarto from the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started)\n\n-   Zotero: For references bibliography and citations. Download and install Zotero from [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org)\n\n-   Better BibTeX (BBT): BBT is a Zotero extension that manages things like citation keys. You can download BBT from: [https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/]().\n\nAll these tools are open source and available for free!\n\n### 5.3.1 Openning Quarto\n\nFirst create a directory/folder where you will save all the files. For example I will create a folder named \"intro_to_quarto\" in my documents directory. This is where you will store all your files.\n\nIn RStudio, go to FILE -\\> New File -\\> Quarto Document\n\nOn the pop-up window, just select \"Create Empty Document\". A blank Quarto page will be open:\n\n![](images/week_5/quarto_open.png)\n\n\nSave the document to folder that you have created\n\n\n### 5.3.2 YAMl\n\nThe first part of the page is know as YAML, it contains the information about the document, this include:\n\n| Option            | Description                                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| `title`           | tittle of the document                                       |\n| `subtitle`        | subtitle of the document                                     |\n| `author`          | Author                                                       |\n| `date`            | date of the document was published                           |\n| `format`          | output of the document: options include html, docx, pdf, etc |\n| `toc`             | table of contents                                            |\n| `number-sections` | Automatically number headings and sections                   |\n| `bibliography`    | a file containing references                                 |\n| `csl`             | referencing style                                            |\n|                   |                                                              |\n\n: Quarto YML Options\n\nThere are many other options that you can use to customise your document; you can a complete guide [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.htmlv). Let us experiment with few options.\n\nLook how I have customised my yaml:\n\n![](images/week_5/quarto_yaml.png)\n\nExperiment with other options. Please not that this must be should start with --- and end with ---.\n\n### 5.3.3 Writing using Markdown\n\n#### Headings\n\nYou insert headings by using \\# at the beginning of a sentence:\n\n![Source: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)](images/week_5/quarto_headings.png)\n\n\nUpdate your document by including headings as follows: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n---\ntitle: \"Introduction to Quarto\"\nsubtitle: \"Writing Reproducible Documents wih Quarto andd RStudio\"\nauthor: \"Aubrey Mpungose\"\ndate: 04 June 2019\ndate-format: \"DD MMMM YYYY\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n---\n\n# Section 1\n\n\n## Section 1.1 \n\n\n### Section 1.1.1 \n\n\n#### Section 1.1.1.1\n\n\n##### Other section\n\n\n###### Other section\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSave and render the document by clicking on the \"Render\" option as highlighted on the image below\n\n\n![](images/week_5/quarto_headings_example.png)\n\n\n\n#### Formating texts\n\n![[Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)](images/week_5/markdown_syntax.png)\n\nUpdate your document as the following and render the document, obviously your name is not Aubrey Mpungose:\n\n![](images/week_5/mark_down_example.png)\n",
